Scikit Learn Mini Project For Predicting Winner of football Match

This was my first data mining project. This
project just aims to get started withdata mining  as well as get my hands dirty working as a Data Analyst.Already exisiting projects on github were refered as learning matherial and Thanks to all such devlopers community.
Data Set:
The data set was obtained through http://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php. The data sets have been attached as separate files in the repository. A file containing the
description of the data set has also been attached. Some columns related to betting statistics are missing from the data but playing statistics are there.
For this particular project, I decided to download data for the last 15 seasons of EPL starting from 2000-01 season to 2014-15 season
